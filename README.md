## 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to perform **sentiment analysis** on textual data such as customer reviews, feedback, or social media posts.  
The system classifies text into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments**, helping organizations understand public opinion and customer emotions.
